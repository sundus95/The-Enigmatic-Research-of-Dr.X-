      "Cancer is a very complicated sequence of disease conditions progressing gradually with a generalized loss of growth control.1–3 There were only a few options of cancer treatment for patients for many decades which include sur- gery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as single treat- ments or in combination.4,5 But recently, many pathways involved in cancer therapy progression and how they can be targeted has improved dramatically, with combinatorial strategies, involving multiple targeted therapies or “tradi- tional” chemotherapeutics, such as the taxanes and platinum compounds, being found to have a synergistic eﬀect.6 New approaches, such as drugs, biological molecules, and immune-mediated therapies, are being used for treatment even if the excepted therapy level has not reached that resists the mortality rate and decreases the prolonged sur- vival time for metastatic cancer.\n",
      "This mechanism is dependent on the active interaction between stem cell CXCR4 receptors and requires their interaction with endothelial cells through LFA-1, VLA-4/5, CD44, and the secretion of matrix degra- dable enzyme MMP-2/9.22 The second mechanism is the tumor-tropic effect in which the migration of MSCs toward tumor microenvironment (TM) after attraction by CXCL16, SDF-1, CCL-25, and IL-6 secreted by tumor cells and dif- ferentiation of MSCs within the tumor cells which contrib- utes to tumor stromal development.24 Stem cells also act by paracrine factor secretion, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) and soluble materials,25 and their differentiation capacity, such as transplanted HSCs, can give rise to all blood cell types.26 Generally, cancer treatment using stem cell therapy by various strategies, including transplantation of HSC,27 MSC infusion,28 therapeutic carriers,29 generation of immune effector cells,30 and vaccine production.31 The stem cell can- cer therapy approach confronted the following side effects: (1) tumorigenesis, (2) adverse events in allogeneic HSC transplantation, (3) drug toxicity and drug resistance, (4) increased immune responses and autoimmunity, and (5) viral infection.22 Despite several successes, there are challenges, such as therapeutic dose control, low cell targeting, and retention in tumor sites, that should be investigated and over- come in the future.\n",
      "This method relies on siRNA-mediated gene silencing of anti- apoptotic proteins, transcription factors (i.e. c-myc gene),64,65 or cancer mutated genes (i.e. K-RAS).66 Advantages of siRNA-based drugs are safety, high effi- cacy, specificity, few side effects, and low costs of produc- tion.67 However, occasionally, they can induce off-target effects or elicit innate immune responses, followed by spe- cific inflammation.68 Delivery methods currently under study are chemical modification (insertion of a phosphorothioate at 3’ end, introduction of a 2’ O-methyl group, and modification by 2,4-dinitrophenol) and lipid encapsulation, or conjugation with organic molecules (polymers, peptides, lipids, antibod- ies, small molecules) efficiently target to spontaneously cross cell membranes of naked siRNAs.69 Interaction of cationic liposomes with negatively charged nucleic acids facilitates easy transfection by simple electrostatic interactions.70 They can be constituted by 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy) propyl]-N, Ntrimethylammonium methyl sulfate (DOTMA).71 Currently, a Phase I clinical trial is recruiting patients for evaluating the safety of Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) targeting 1,2-dioleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) encapsulated siRNA (siRNA-EphA2- DOPC) in patients with advanced and recur- rent cancer.72 siRNAs can be concentrated in cationic poly- mers, such as chitosan, cyclodextrin, and polyethyleneimine (PEI).73 CALAA-01 is one of the cyclodextrin polymers con- jugated with human transferrin is being entered a Phase I clinical trial.\n",

      "So those problems are intervened by cellular mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, proliferation pre- vention, and interfering with metabolic reprogramming by targeted drug therapy agents.36 Modifying TM and targeting TM for drug delivery for effective treatment are two strate- gies that can be used for the treatment of cancer.37 Targeted therapy drugs do work in different ways from standard chemotherapy drugs treatment like attacking cancer cells while doing less damage to normal cells which is a program- ming that sets them apart from normal, healthy cells.38 Using targeted therapy markedly increased the survival rate for some diseases, for example, from 17% to 24% in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, the addition of erlotinib to standard chemotherapy.\n",
      "They contain a more proportion of human components than murine components.43 Their attack mechanisms of action are recruiting host immune functions to attack the target cell, binding to ligands or receptors thereby interrupting essential cancer cell processes, and carrying a lethal payload, such as radioisotope or toxin, to the target cell.44 Gemtuzumab is an example of a CD-33- specific monoclonal antibody currently used for AML treatment by conjugating with calicheamicin.45 In addition, ibritumomab tiuxetan is an anti-CD20, a 90Y metal iso- tope-based is developed in clinical therapy.46 Delivery of active therapeutics, prodrug activation enzymes, and chem- otherapy toxins are also another use of target agents of monoclonal antibodies.47 Small molecule inhibitors These are smaller protein in size (⩽500 Da) than monoclonal antibodies, so that they can simply translocate through plasma membranes and can be taken orally.\n",
